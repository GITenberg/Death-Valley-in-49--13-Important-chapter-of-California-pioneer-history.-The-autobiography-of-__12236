description: William Lewis Manly (1820-1903) and his family left Vermont in 1828,
  and he grew to manhood in Michigan and Wisconsin. On hearing the news of gold in
  California, Manly set off on horseback, joining an emigrant party in Missouri. Death
  Valley in '49 (1894) contains Manly's account of that overland journey. Setting
  out too late in the year to risk a northern passage thorugh the Sierras, the group
  takes the southern route to California, unluckily choosing an untried short cut
  through the mountains. This fateful decision brings the party through Death Valley,
  and Manly describes their trek through the desert, as well as the experiences of
  the Illinois "Jayhawkers" and others who took the Death Valley route. Manly's memoirs
  continue with his trip north to prospecting near the Mariposa mines, a brief trip
  back east via the Isthmus, and his return to California and another try at prospecting
  on the North Fork of the Yuba at Downieville in 1851. He provides lively ancedotes
  of life in mining camps and of his visits to Stockton, Sacramento, and San Francisco.
